After signing up and logging in for the first time, the first thing you'll want to do is add all of your accounts.

In dollargrad, you'll budget only what you have available to spend and not on your estimated monthly income, so everytime you login, you know exactly how much you've budgeted, and if you'll have enough to cover upcoming expenses.

Let's start by adding all of our accounts, but before we do:

if at any point you have a question, whether you're looking to get the most out of dollargrad, or if you're a little unsure if you should be doing things one way or another, hit the HELP CENTER link in the bottom right corner. Select a topic, and submit a message. Day or night, and in most cases we'll reach back within the hour.

Let's jump back to our budget by clicking "my budget" in the top right, and hit the big green button to add your first account.

You'll be presented with 4 options: Checking, Savings, Cash and Loan. The first three are considered cash accounts, and the total balance across these will be immedietly available to budget.

Let's hit checking to start.

Supply a name: Chase Checking
Enter your account's current balance: 1000, and hit create account.

You now have money available to budget.

Let's add another account. I'll select cash this time, Give it a name, and I have 50 in cash, and now I have 1050 available to budget.

Let's add another account, but this time let's use dollargrad to help us manage our debt. 

Hit the loan type, in my case I want to manage my Discover Card, and..... I owe 200 on my card. Hit add, and.....you'll notice two things happened. First, to be budgeted didn't change. That's because balance on debt accounts do not effect the total you have available to budget.

But.... we do see a new category was created. This is a payment category. We'll learn how these work in the next video. For now, I'm just going to change the due date on this category before I forget, by clicking the category, supplying a date that my cc payment is due... and my minimum payment is 25.

All right. checkout part two, where we'll go over budget categories, and assign what we have available to spend. See you there!
